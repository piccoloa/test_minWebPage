        "title": "Data Lakes: Overview",
        "excerpt":"Oxford Botanic Garden Pond Part 1 Notes From Concept to Implementation This is the first blog under the topic Data Lakes and will be followed by additional topics pertaining to data lakes.  Each post will start with the title Data Lakes followed by a [:new topic].  Each topic will go deeper and share additional details and links to practical tools that I have discovered.  The goal is to better understand the impact of data lakes on the analytics value chain.   This post broadly covers the following questions:   Where did the data lake concept originate?  What are the problems that data lakes are solving or not solving?  What are the typical components of enterprise data lakes?  How are data lakes being used to increase productivity or share data?  What are the data governance issues that need to be addressed?1. **Where did the data lake concept originate? “Google, Facebook and Yahoo had discovered big data before anyone else, but it was obvious that it was coming to banks, hospitals and other traditional companies. Enterprises had already realized that cloud computing was important. They were rebuilding their data centers to be cloudy. We realized that a once‑in‑a‑generation technology change was underway, and knew that we had a chance to create a company to deliver the modern platform for big data”  Cloudera.  While not inventing the term, Cloudera embraced the Apache open source projects to build a data management platform that could scale the way of Google, Facebook and Yahoo. Prior to data lakes, technologies were architected and created to solve specific data related problems.  These special purpose legacy architectures were expensive and inflexible.  Examples of these systems included relational databases for back-office reporting and billing, to large document management systems for storing unstructured data.  Those companies born from the web were the first to encounter the limitations of processing large volumes of data with data of different variety.  Building on the idea’s of  Google, Apache Hadoop software was created by Doug Cutting and Mike Carfarella.  Hadoop was comprised of HDFS and MapReduce technologies. The primary use of a data lake is to store data.  The Apache Hadoop project is primarily spoken of as the source for storing data and has become the default term by most data professionals when referring to data lakes. 2. **What are the problems that data lakes are solving or not solving? Data lakes are perceived very much in the same light as the original data warehouse. The promise of answering important strategic as well as predicting success or failure based on large volumes of data have been the primary reason to spend. Predicting the future is not easy. Many of the data science or predictive models have not had as high returns as originally thought.  More successful approaches to implementing data lakes have started with a small single cross departmental data problem that can show a high ROI.  A project such as reducing customer churn that reaches across two or three organizations including support, product analytics, sales and a renewals team could be one example.  Another project could be one related to a central point of governance.  This could be a data lake to create a centralized entity resolution dataset to monitor and manage sensitive data. The transforming of data, or the T in ETL (extracting, transforming, and loading) is the process where Hadoop has been thought to cause the greatest improvements.  Because much of the transforming of data in the process is done on an ETL server, a Hadoop cluster architecture is much more efficient at transforming the data as it gets loaded to the data lake.  Additionally, data that is not in tabular form can be saved in its native form and avoid converting the data to a target schema.   This is especially important to vast volumes of unstructured IOT data. Some of the other benefits include allowing for non-programmers to create data visualizations, reports, dashboard and SQL like access to provide for analysis. One of the pitfalls to Data lakes has been couched in the “data puddles” term.  These stranded data lakes become a problem when the proliferation of data lakes leads to data quality and cost problems of implementing duplicative systems.  Data puddles are meant to be avoided with the proper implementation by IT versus separate business initiatives. 3.  **What are the typical components of enterprise data lakes? Hadoop is a massively parallel storage and execution platform.  Hadoop includes a distributed files system (HDFS) that some vendors like MapR and IBM provide their own proprietary files systems. Hadoop is a platform and an ecosystem that incorporates many of the most used open source projects including Hive and Spark.  Hive allows for SQL like interface to Hadoop and Spark turns Hadoop to an in-memory execution system.  Hadoop provides for an extremely scalable cost effective system that is modular in form.  The system has a schema-on-read architecture unlike relational databases.  The schema-on-read nature of Hadoop allows for data to be added quickly to the data lake without needing to know the structure of the data to write to disk.  This avoids the high cost of processing the data when it is being collected and written to the store. Many of the same issues regarding data quality continue to be components that must be addressed with data lakes.  Data completeness,  data type (string, number..) format, cardinality (unique values) and referential integrity are rules that still need to be considered when designing and implementing data lakes. One added concept to data lakes is lineage.  Lineage accounts for setting priorities based on where the data was derived.  Understanding the source of the data was from a spreadsheet or from a system of record will be key to understanding which data has priority.  Implementing lineage can be difficult as multiple tools could be used to access the same dataset without the data lake understanding the same data is being added. There are some that would argue that one ETL tool could provide a more rigorous approach to centralizing the collection process. Granularity and transformation of data are two concepts that a data lake needs to consider to create reliable data sets.  Within granularity, data set level refers to the  directed graph representation of relationship between datasets while field level lineage is also represented between fields. The transformational representation needs to be translated to a common representation where the lineage of the data needs to be interpreted in a manner that can be more easily understood despite all changes that have occurred.  Read more about the process whereby the focus on denormalization becomes critical in the context of the data lake and specifically in terms of any associated Hadoop/HDFS data structures.  Above is an example of a generic data lake architecture from Alex Gorelik’s book The Enterprise Big Data Lake.The raw or landing zone within the data lake context is usually where files are loaded from external systems.  The gold area is where it is transformed data, while the work folder with data is where users projects and data is stored.  The sensitive data area is where the encrypted files are stored. Given the size of the data lake and lack of a search function, finding relevant data is extremely cumbersome in a data lake without a catalog.  Although Hue, the Hadoop utility, allows for some limited preview of data files additional tools from vendors like Teradata’s Loom  and Waterline Data Inventory are used to catalog Hadoop data besides relational databases to run outside of Hadoop for the cataloging data. Additional cataloging tools are available from Cloudera’s Navigator product.  One open source project, Apache Atlas, has been created to help solve the meta data and governance framework for Hadoop. 4.  **How are data lakes being used to increase productivity or share data? Besides the technical requirements, some organizations are struggling to implement Hadoop as there is a battle between the silos of the business user and IT for control of the Hadoop cluster.   This is where the democratization of data is one of the first steps to capitalizing on a companies digital assets. Like markets, the potential of data is curtailed when data is not transparent.  Early in my transition to using corporate data, I discovered the only way to perform any meaningful analysis was to ask questions of the available data. I quickly realized that unless I was querying the data myself, the data was either out of date or incomplete. I subsequently took my first database class at the local community college.  New self-service tools such as Tableau and Qlik are allowing power users or subject matter experts to create and transform data to allow business users to more quickly access the data to help answer business questions. The problem with the traditional business analyst process of the past is the data needed to be found, provisioned, prepped, and then analyzed.  Part of the process included creating critical data elements can not rapidly change as according to new user requirements . This is a complete contrast to growing up with Google and Wikipedia.  The pure volume of data makes it impossible to document and tag everything, this is where new tools that leverage machine learning and auto-tracking of data consumption creates catalogs of tribal knowledge.  This is much a kin to the search scoring that powers search engines. In order to make consumption of the data easier, many tools are being used to prepare the data to be consumed applications.  This is where the data wrangling aspect of most data mining and data science projects spend the majority of the time. Like Excel, which is impractical for large data lake files, newer tools are being used to clean and shape the data to the right form.  Some of the vendors providing these tools are Alteryx, Datameer, Paxata, and Trifacta as well as traditional vendors such as Informatica and Talend provide tools with the idea of providing self-service for the business analyst. Combining data or joining data sets is where much of the value from data lakes becomes immediately useful.  Unfortunately, common ids are uncommon amongst separate data sets.  This is where the idea of entity resolution becomes instrumental in capturing value from the data.  Master Data Management systems with probabilistic matching engines that have rules for defining matched entities help in joining data sets.  One company providing entity resolution products is Tamr. 5.  **What are the data governance issues that need to be addressed? The centralized nature of a data lake could allow for greater governance versus heterogenous systems that use different technologies.  Stewardship of data lakes is key to creating trusted users that have organizational responsibility for the data.  Some form of provisioning of the data is one of the critical problems of data lakes.  One approach that has been widely adopted is only allowing analysts access to data they need for there specific job function.  An example could be allowing access based on location or some other form of limiting data. Data lake users and zones are typically segmented into four zones: a landing zone where data scientists, developers, and data engineers have access; a gold zone where analysts and data scientists have access; a work zone for data scientists and data engineers; and finally a sensitive zone where data stewards and trusted analysts have access. One approach to governance is to implement a method for de-identifying sensitive data.  Since the data is written quickly without schema, the ability to tag data on original write is limited for efficiency reasons.  Some profiling tools have been built to scan the data lake and look for sensitive data.  These tools include DataGuise and Waterline Data. Another approach is transparent encryption that is offered by Cloudera Navigator  that encrypts data when it is written and de-crypts the data when read.

        "excerpt":"What is Entity Resolution? Entity Resolution is the task of disambiguating manifestations of real world entities in various records or mentions by linking and grouping.1 Effectively reducing something to its most basic conical form. Linking entities to form relationships and draw conclusions from data is becoming increasingly relevant as data lakes become prevalent in organizations and protecting data integrity expectations increases especially as it relates to making use of private personal data. Many organizations ranging from government and public health data, web search, comparison shopping, law enforcement are being expected to provide a higher level of transparency and protection of the data being collected and used for predicting behavior and accomplishing their goals.

        "excerpt":"Exploring different models to eliminate redundant and erroneous text records from different sources to manage personally identifiable information(PII) Overview Identify and link the Same Person Complying with privacy and information security laws is increasingly becoming more challenging for individuals and organizations.  Events such as the 2017 Equifax data breach of 143 million individual identities is becoming a more common occurrence.  Even more concerning, in 2017, Yahoo revised its 2013 500 million Yahoo user identity breach to 3 billion identities being stolen.  The scale of these security breaches impact on an organization’s perceived business value and the direct negative financial implications from lax regulatory adherence should not be underestimated.1 According to wikipedia, “personally identifiable information(PII) or sensitive personal information as used in information security and privacy laws…has four common variants based on personal | personally, and identifiable | identifying”  information.  Protecting personal information is governed according to privacy principles in most OECD countries.  In Europe, data protection laws are mainly focused on General Data Protection Regulation(GDPR).Depending on jurisdiction and differing regulatory pressures, an organizations abilities to comply with protecting PII starts with managing data assets effectively and promoting a culture that values privacy and digital policies.  One of the most challenging aspects of complying with regulatory or managing reputational risks associated with keeping PII information secure is an organization’s ability to maintain information governance standards that effectively manages personal identifiable information.2 One such approach to managing PII data more effectively is for organizations to identify and link persons across all its data assets into one consolidated entity resolution index.  Basic information governance will result from combining datasets and performing large aggregate analyses using powerful new ways to improve service across large populations. Critically important in this task is the deduplication of identities across multiple data sets that were rarely designed to work together. Inconsistent data entry, typographical errors, and real world identity changes pose significant challenges to this process. Besides adhering to PII standards, the ability to correlate personal identities from disparate data sources allows approximate joins to occur giving increased value to the joined datasets.  One could consider the Department of Homeland Security attempt at joining passenger data with homeland security no-fly lists and the and other potential terrorism security measures an extreme in linking related personal identities. Description of Concepts Learned “Entity resolution is to distinguish the representations referring to the same real world object entity in one or more databases and recognize all different real-world entities in the databases.”3 According to Wang there are two main types of classifications of entity resolution based on pairwise entity resolution and group-wise entity resolution.  As an example, for entity resolution on name set {o1=“Wei Wang”, o2=“W Wei”, o3=“Wang Wei”, o4=“Jian Pei”} the result of pair-wise entity resolution is {(o1, o2), (o1, o3), (o2, o3)} The  pairwise resolution refers to a pair of data objects referring to the same real-world entity while the group-wire resolution refers to a family clusters with each data object referring to the same real-world entity.   The challenges of entity resolution relate to the size of data, the frequency of data updates, the structure of the data, and the accuracy of entity resolution.  For the scope of this project, the data quality management aspect of resolving the same entity in different databases will be explored.  The main concept to be learned will be to find duplicate tuples as they relate to a firm’s individual contact information.  The ability to clean dirty data by detecting the objects referring to the same real world entity will result in a consolidated entity based management approach. Creating a single source for entity management will allow more effective maintenance and deletion of such entities from the systems containing personally identifiable information. While Wang’s approach to entity resolution is more a kin to using similarity computations, Mikhail Bilenko’s approach describes “Learnable Similarity Functions”4 as the best means to reducing entities to there most basic form. Entity resolution on names and context-based entity resolution will be explored. Time permitting, further research in regard to the ER problem as widely used in many domains such as natural language processing (NLP), machine learning and databases will be explored. In short, the models explored will explore the most accurate methods for merging customer lists using personal identity variables to avoid redundancy and allow for a master list for more efficient management of personal identities.

It is the nightly custom of every good mother after her children are asleep to rummage in their minds and put things straight for next morning, repacking into their proper places the many articles that have wandered during the day. This post has a manual excerpt &lt;!--more--&gt; set after the second paragraph. The following YAML Front Matter has also be applied: excerpt_separator: \"&lt;!--more--&gt;\"If you could keep awake (but of course you can’t) you would see your own mother doing this, and you would find it very interesting to watch her. It is quite like tidying up drawers. You would see her on her knees, I expect, lingering humorously over some of your contents, wondering where on earth you had picked this thing up, making discoveries sweet and not so sweet, pressing this to her cheek as if it were as nice as a kitten, and hurriedly stowing that out of sight. When you wake in the morning, the naughtiness and evil passions with which you went to bed have been folded up small and placed at the bottom of your mind and on the top, beautifully aired, are spread out your prettier thoughts, ready for you to put on. I don’t know whether you have ever seen a map of a person’s mind. Doctors sometimes draw maps of other parts of you, and your own map can become intensely interesting, but catch them trying to draw a map of a child’s mind, which is not only confused, but keeps going round all the time. There are zigzag lines on it, just like your temperature on a card, and these are probably roads in the island, for the Neverland is always more or less an island, with astonishing splashes of colour here and there, and coral reefs and rakish-looking craft in the offing, and savages and lonely lairs, and gnomes who are mostly tailors, and caves through which a river runs, and princes with six elder brothers, and a hut fast going to decay, and one very small old lady with a hooked nose. It would be an easy map if that were all, but there is also first day at school, religion, fathers, the round pond, needle-work, murders, hangings, verbs that take the dative, chocolate pudding day, getting into braces, say ninety-nine, three-pence for pulling out your tooth yourself, and so on, and either these are part of the island or they are another map showing through, and it is all rather confusing, especially as nothing will stand still. Of course the Neverlands vary a good deal. John’s, for instance, had a lagoon with flamingoes flying over it at which John was shooting, while Michael, who was very small, had a flamingo with lagoons flying over it. John lived in a boat turned upside down on the sands, Michael in a wigwam, Wendy in a house of leaves deftly sewn together. John had no friends, Michael had friends at night, Wendy had a pet wolf forsaken by its parents, but on the whole the Neverlands have a family resemblance, and if they stood still in a row you could say of them that they have each other’s nose, and so forth. On these magic shores children at play are for ever beaching their coracles [simple boat]. We too have been there; we can still hear the sound of the surf, though we shall land no more. Of all delectable islands the Neverland is the snuggest and most compact, not large and sprawly, you know, with tedious distances between one adventure and another, but nicely crammed. When you play at it by day with the chairs and table-cloth, it is not in the least alarming, but in the two minutes before you go to sleep it becomes very real. That is why there are night-lights. Occasionally in her travels through her children’s minds Mrs. Darling found things she could not understand, and of these quite the most perplexing was the word Peter. She knew of no Peter, and yet he was here and there in John and Michael’s minds, while Wendy’s began to be scrawled all over with him. The name stood out in bolder letters than any of the other words, and as Mrs. Darling gazed she felt that it had an oddly cocky appearance. ","categories": ["Post Formats"],

Now, on the St. Louis team we have Who’s on first, What’s on second, I Don’t Know is on third– Costello: That’s what I want to find out. I want you to tell me the names of the fellows on the St. Louis team. Abbott: I’m telling you. Who’s on first, What’s on second, I Don’t Know is on third– Costello: You know the fellows’ names? Abbott: Yes. Costello: Well, then who’s playing first? Abbott: Yes. Costello: I mean the fellow’s name on first base. Abbott: Who. Costello: The fellow playin’ first base. Abbott: Who. Costello: The guy on first base. Abbott: Who is on first. Costello: Well, what are you askin’ me for? Abbott: I’m not asking you–I’m telling you. Who is on first. Costello: I’m asking you–who’s on first? Abbott: That’s the man’s name. Costello: That’s who’s name? Abbott: Yes. Costello: When you pay off the first baseman every month, who gets the money? Abbott: Every dollar of it. And why not, the man’s entitled to it. Costello: Who is? Abbott: Yes. Costello: So who gets it? Abbott: Why shouldn’t he? Sometimes his wife comes down and collects it. Costello: Who’s wife? Abbott: Yes. After all, the man earns it. Costello: Who does? Abbott: Absolutely. Costello: Well, all I’m trying to find out is what’s the guy’s name on first base? Abbott: Oh, no, no. What is on second base. Costello: I’m not asking you who’s on second. Abbott: Who’s on first! Costello: St. Louis has a good outfield? Abbott: Oh, absolutely. Costello: The left fielder’s name? Abbott: Why. Costello: I don’t know, I just thought I’d ask. Abbott: Well, I just thought I’d tell you. Costello: Then tell me who’s playing left field? Abbott: Who’s playing first. Costello: Stay out of the infield! The left fielder’s name? Abbott: Why. Costello: Because. Abbott: Oh, he’s center field. Costello: Wait a minute. You got a pitcher on this team? Abbott: Wouldn’t this be a fine team without a pitcher? Costello: Tell me the pitcher’s name. Abbott: Tomorrow. Costello: Now, when the guy at bat bunts the ball–me being a good catcher–I want to throw the guy out at first base, so I pick up the ball and throw it to who? Abbott: Now, that’s he first thing you’ve said right. Costello: I DON’T EVEN KNOW WHAT I’M TALKING ABOUT! Abbott: Don’t get excited. Take it easy. Costello: I throw the ball to first base, whoever it is grabs the ball, so the guy runs to second. Who picks up the ball and throws it to what. What throws it to I don’t know. I don’t know throws it back to tomorrow–a triple play. Abbott: Yeah, it could be. Costello: Another guy gets up and it’s a long ball to center. Abbott: Because. Costello: Why? I don’t know. And I don’t care. Abbott: What was that? Costello: I said, I DON’T CARE! Abbott: Oh, that’s our shortstop! ","categories": ["Post Formats"],

The estimated time that it takes to read this post should not be showing if read_time: false is set in _config.yml or in this post’s YAML Front Matter. If you could keep awake (but of course you can’t) you would see your own mother doing this, and you would find it very interesting to watch her. It is quite like tidying up drawers. You would see her on her knees, I expect, lingering humorously over some of your contents, wondering where on earth you had picked this thing up, making discoveries sweet and not so sweet, pressing this to her cheek as if it were as nice as a kitten, and hurriedly stowing that out of sight. When you wake in the morning, the naughtiness and evil passions with which you went to bed have been folded up small and placed at the bottom of your mind and on the top, beautifully aired, are spread out your prettier thoughts, ready for you to put on. I don’t know whether you have ever seen a map of a person’s mind. Doctors sometimes draw maps of other parts of you, and your own map can become intensely interesting, but catch them trying to draw a map of a child’s mind, which is not only confused, but keeps going round all the time. There are zigzag lines on it, just like your temperature on a card, and these are probably roads in the island, for the Neverland is always more or less an island, with astonishing splashes of colour here and there, and coral reefs and rakish-looking craft in the offing, and savages and lonely lairs, and gnomes who are mostly tailors, and caves through which a river runs, and princes with six elder brothers, and a hut fast going to decay, and one very small old lady with a hooked nose. It would be an easy map if that were all, but there is also first day at school, religion, fathers, the round pond, needle-work, murders, hangings, verbs that take the dative, chocolate pudding day, getting into braces, say ninety-nine, three-pence for pulling out your tooth yourself, and so on, and either these are part of the island or they are another map showing through, and it is all rather confusing, especially as nothing will stand still. Of course the Neverlands vary a good deal. John’s, for instance, had a lagoon with flamingoes flying over it at which John was shooting, while Michael, who was very small, had a flamingo with lagoons flying over it. John lived in a boat turned upside down on the sands, Michael in a wigwam, Wendy in a house of leaves deftly sewn together. John had no friends, Michael had friends at night, Wendy had a pet wolf forsaken by its parents, but on the whole the Neverlands have a family resemblance, and if they stood still in a row you could say of them that they have each other’s nose, and so forth. On these magic shores children at play are for ever beaching their coracles [simple boat]. We too have been there; we can still hear the sound of the surf, though we shall land no more. Of all delectable islands the Neverland is the snuggest and most compact, not large and sprawly, you know, with tedious distances between one adventure and another, but nicely crammed. When you play at it by day with the chairs and table-cloth, it is not in the least alarming, but in the two minutes before you go to sleep it becomes very real. That is why there are night-lights. Occasionally in her travels through her children’s minds Mrs. Darling found things she could not understand, and of these quite the most perplexing was the word Peter. She knew of no Peter, and yet he was here and there in John and Michael’s minds, while Wendy’s began to be scrawled all over with him. The name stood out in bolder letters than any of the other words, and as Mrs. Darling gazed she felt that it had an oddly cocky appearance. ","categories": [],

        "excerpt":"Default This is a paragraph. It should not have any alignment of any kind. It should just flow like you would normally expect. Nothing fancy. Just straight up text, free flowing, with love. Completely neutral and not picking a side or sitting on the fence. It just is. It just freaking is. It likes where it is. It does not feel compelled to pick a side. Leave him be. It will just be better that way. Trust me. Left Align This is a paragraph. It is left aligned. Because of this, it is a bit more liberal in it’s views. It’s favorite color is green. Left align tends to be more eco-friendly, but it provides no concrete evidence that it really is. Even though it likes share the wealth evenly, it leaves the equal distribution up to justified alignment. Center Align This is a paragraph. It is center aligned. Center is, but nature, a fence sitter. A flip flopper. It has a difficult time making up its mind. It wants to pick a side. Really, it does. It has the best intentions, but it tends to complicate matters more than help. The best you can do is try to win it over and hope for the best. I hear center align does take bribes. Right Align This is a paragraph. It is right aligned. It is a bit more conservative in it’s views. It’s prefers to not be told what to do or how to do it. Right align totally owns a slew of guns and loves to head to the range for some practice. Which is cool and all. I mean, it’s a pretty good shot from at least four or five football fields away. Dead on. So boss. Justify Align This is a paragraph. It is justify aligned. It gets really mad when people associate it with Justin Timberlake. Typically, justified is pretty straight laced. It likes everything to be in it’s place and not all cattywampus like the rest of the aligns. I am not saying that makes it better than the rest of the aligns, but it does tend to put off more of an elitist attitude. ","categories": ["Markup"],

        "excerpt":"Welcome to image alignment! The best way to demonstrate the ebb and flow of the various image positioning options is to nestle them snuggly among an ocean of words. Grab a paddle and let’s get started.  The image above happens to be centered.  The rest of this paragraph is filler for the sake of seeing the text wrap around the 150×150 image, which is left aligned. As you can see the should be some space above, below, and to the right of the image. The text should not be creeping on the image. Creeping is just not right. Images need breathing room too. Let them speak like you words. Let them do their jobs without any hassle from the text. In about one more sentence here, we’ll see that the text moves from the right of the image down below the image in seamless transition. Again, letting the do it’s thing. Mission accomplished! And now for a massively large image. It also has no alignment.  The image above, though 1200px wide, should not overflow the content area. It should remain contained with no visible disruption to the flow of content.  And now we’re going to shift things to the right align. Again, there should be plenty of room above, below, and to the left of the image. Just look at him there — Hey guy! Way to rock that right side. I don’t care what the left aligned image says, you look great. Don’t let anyone else tell you differently. In just a bit here, you should see the text start to wrap below the right aligned image and settle in nicely. There should still be plenty of room and everything should be sitting pretty. Yeah — Just like that. It never felt so good to be right. And just when you thought we were done, we’re going to do them all over again with captions!     Look at 580 x 300 getting some love.The figure above happens to be centered. The caption also has a link in it, just to see if it does anything funky.     Itty-bitty caption.The rest of this paragraph is filler for the sake of seeing the text wrap around the 150×150 image, which is left aligned.

        "title": "Gemified Theme -- Alpha Release",
        "excerpt":"Jekyll themes distributed as Ruby gems are finally here to make installing and upgrading much easier. Gone are the days of forking a repo just to “install it”. Or dealing with merge conflicts when pulling in upstream commits to “upgrade it”. If you’re interested in testing out Minimal Mistakes as a gemified theme read on. There are a few caveats though:   Support for a theme assets folder was recently added to Jekyll core, but has yet to be released or rolled into the github-pages gem. Meaning you can’t use Minimal Mistakes as a Ruby gem there just yet… locally served or self-hosted installs should be fine if you don’t mind using a pre-release version of Jekyll.  Windows users can’t currently use themes packaged as gems due to a bug with file paths in Jekyll core. This is being worked on so hopefully a fix is on the way soon.Fine with all that? Great. Let’s continue. If you’re migrating a site already using Minimal Mistakes and haven’t customized any of the _includes, _layouts, _sass partials, or assets this should be quick and painless. Step 1: Remove Theme Files Remove _includes, _layouts, _sass, assets folders and files within. You won’t need these anymore as they’re bundled in the theme. If you customized any of these then leave them alone and only remove the untouched ones. If setup correctly your modified versions should act as overrides to the versions bundled with the theme. Step 2: Update Gemfile In order to test you’ll need to install pre-release gems of Jekyll and Minimal Mistakes. Start by replacing gem \"github-pages\" or gem \"jekyll\" with the following: gem \"jekyll\", :git =&gt; \"https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll.git\"Then add the pre-release Minimal Mistakes theme gem: gem \"minimal-mistakes-jekyll\", :git =&gt; \"https://github.com/mmistakes/minimal-mistakes.git\", :branch =&gt; \"feature/theme-gem\"`When finished your Gemfile should look something like this: source \"https://rubygems.org\"gem \"jekyll\", :git =&gt; \"https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll.git\"gem \"minimal-mistakes-jekyll\", :git =&gt; \"https://github.com/mmistakes/minimal-mistakes.git\", :branch =&gt; \"feature/theme-gem\"group :jekyll_plugins do  # gem \"jekyll-archives\"  gem \"jekyll-paginate\"  gem \"jekyll-sitemap\"  gem \"jekyll-gist\"  gem \"jekyll-feed\"  gem \"jemoji\"endStep 3: Run Bundler Run bundle install (or bundle update if you’re updating an existing repo) to install the pre-release gems. Step 4: Install the Theme Add theme: \"minimal-mistakes-jekyll\" to your _config.yml file. If you’re migrating from an existing Minimal Mistakes site you shouldn’t have to change anything else after this. If it’s a new site consult then docs to properly config. Please Note: Paths for image headers, overlays, teasers, galleries, and feature rows have changed and now require a full path. Instead of just image: filename.jpg you’ll need to use the full path eg: image: assets/images/filename.jpg. The preferred location is now assets/images but can be placed elsewhere or external hosted. This applies for image references in _config.yml and author.yml. Step 5: jekyll new Tweaks If this is a new site be sure to add the following files to _data/ and customize as you see fit. There is currently no way of bundling them in with the theme, so be sure to consult the docs on how to properly use both.   _data/ui-text.yml - UI text documentation  _data/navigation.yml - navigation documentationYou’ll also need to:   Replace &lt;site root&gt;/index.html with a modified Minimal Mistakes index.html.  Change layout: post in _posts/0000-00-00-welcome-to-jekyll.markdown to layout: single.  Remove about.md, or at the very least change layout: page to layout: single and remove references to icon-github.html (or copy to your _includes if using).That’s it! If all goes well running bundle exec jekyll serve should spin-up your site.

        "title": "Data Lakes: Overview- in posts",
        "excerpt":"Oxford Botanic Garden Pond Part 1 Notes From Concept to Implementation This is the first blog under the topic Data Lakes and will be followed by additional topics pertaining to data lakes.  Each post will start with the title Data Lakes followed by a [:new topic].  Each topic will go deeper and share additional details and links to practical tools that I have discovered.  The goal is to better understand the impact of data lakes on the analytics value chain.   This post broadly covers the following questions:   Where did the data lake concept originate?  What are the problems that data lakes are solving or not solving?  What are the typical components of enterprise data lakes?  How are data lakes being used to increase productivity or share data?  What are the data governance issues that need to be addressed?1. **Where did the data lake concept originate? “Google, Facebook and Yahoo had discovered big data before anyone else, but it was obvious that it was coming to banks, hospitals and other traditional companies. Enterprises had already realized that cloud computing was important. They were rebuilding their data centers to be cloudy. We realized that a once‑in‑a‑generation technology change was underway, and knew that we had a chance to create a company to deliver the modern platform for big data”  Cloudera.  While not inventing the term, Cloudera embraced the Apache open source projects to build a data management platform that could scale the way of Google, Facebook and Yahoo. Prior to data lakes, technologies were architected and created to solve specific data related problems.  These special purpose legacy architectures were expensive and inflexible.  Examples of these systems included relational databases for back-office reporting and billing, to large document management systems for storing unstructured data.  Those companies born from the web were the first to encounter the limitations of processing large volumes of data with data of different variety.  Building on the idea’s of  Google, Apache Hadoop software was created by Doug Cutting and Mike Carfarella.  Hadoop was comprised of HDFS and MapReduce technologies. The primary use of a data lake is to store data.  The Apache Hadoop project is primarily spoken of as the source for storing data and has become the default term by most data professionals when referring to data lakes. 2. **What are the problems that data lakes are solving or not solving? Data lakes are perceived very much in the same light as the original data warehouse. The promise of answering important strategic as well as predicting success or failure based on large volumes of data have been the primary reason to spend. Predicting the future is not easy. Many of the data science or predictive models have not had as high returns as originally thought.  More successful approaches to implementing data lakes have started with a small single cross departmental data problem that can show a high ROI.  A project such as reducing customer churn that reaches across two or three organizations including support, product analytics, sales and a renewals team could be one example.  Another project could be one related to a central point of governance.  This could be a data lake to create a centralized entity resolution dataset to monitor and manage sensitive data. The transforming of data, or the T in ETL (extracting, transforming, and loading) is the process where Hadoop has been thought to cause the greatest improvements.  Because much of the transforming of data in the process is done on an ETL server, a Hadoop cluster architecture is much more efficient at transforming the data as it gets loaded to the data lake.  Additionally, data that is not in tabular form can be saved in its native form and avoid converting the data to a target schema.   This is especially important to vast volumes of unstructured IOT data. Some of the other benefits include allowing for non-programmers to create data visualizations, reports, dashboard and SQL like access to provide for analysis. One of the pitfalls to Data lakes has been couched in the “data puddles” term.  These stranded data lakes become a problem when the proliferation of data lakes leads to data quality and cost problems of implementing duplicative systems.  Data puddles are meant to be avoided with the proper implementation by IT versus separate business initiatives. 3.  **What are the typical components of enterprise data lakes? Hadoop is a massively parallel storage and execution platform.  Hadoop includes a distributed files system (HDFS) that some vendors like MapR and IBM provide their own proprietary files systems. Hadoop is a platform and an ecosystem that incorporates many of the most used open source projects including Hive and Spark.  Hive allows for SQL like interface to Hadoop and Spark turns Hadoop to an in-memory execution system.  Hadoop provides for an extremely scalable cost effective system that is modular in form.  The system has a schema-on-read architecture unlike relational databases.  The schema-on-read nature of Hadoop allows for data to be added quickly to the data lake without needing to know the structure of the data to write to disk.  This avoids the high cost of processing the data when it is being collected and written to the store. Many of the same issues regarding data quality continue to be components that must be addressed with data lakes.  Data completeness,  data type (string, number..) format, cardinality (unique values) and referential integrity are rules that still need to be considered when designing and implementing data lakes. One added concept to data lakes is lineage.  Lineage accounts for setting priorities based on where the data was derived.  Understanding the source of the data was from a spreadsheet or from a system of record will be key to understanding which data has priority.  Implementing lineage can be difficult as multiple tools could be used to access the same dataset without the data lake understanding the same data is being added. There are some that would argue that one ETL tool could provide a more rigorous approach to centralizing the collection process. Granularity and transformation of data are two concepts that a data lake needs to consider to create reliable data sets.  Within granularity, data set level refers to the  directed graph representation of relationship between datasets while field level lineage is also represented between fields. The transformational representation needs to be translated to a common representation where the lineage of the data needs to be interpreted in a manner that can be more easily understood despite all changes that have occurred.  Read more about the process whereby the focus on denormalization becomes critical in the context of the data lake and specifically in terms of any associated Hadoop/HDFS data structures.  Above is an example of a generic data lake architecture from Alex Gorelik’s book The Enterprise Big Data Lake.The raw or landing zone within the data lake context is usually where files are loaded from external systems.  The gold area is where it is transformed data, while the work folder with data is where users projects and data is stored.  The sensitive data area is where the encrypted files are stored. Given the size of the data lake and lack of a search function, finding relevant data is extremely cumbersome in a data lake without a catalog.  Although Hue, the Hadoop utility, allows for some limited preview of data files additional tools from vendors like Teradata’s Loom  and Waterline Data Inventory are used to catalog Hadoop data besides relational databases to run outside of Hadoop for the cataloging data. Additional cataloging tools are available from Cloudera’s Navigator product.  One open source project, Apache Atlas, has been created to help solve the meta data and governance framework for Hadoop. 4.  **How are data lakes being used to increase productivity or share data? Besides the technical requirements, some organizations are struggling to implement Hadoop as there is a battle between the silos of the business user and IT for control of the Hadoop cluster.   This is where the democratization of data is one of the first steps to capitalizing on a companies digital assets. Like markets, the potential of data is curtailed when data is not transparent.  Early in my transition to using corporate data, I discovered the only way to perform any meaningful analysis was to ask questions of the available data. I quickly realized that unless I was querying the data myself, the data was either out of date or incomplete. I subsequently took my first database class at the local community college.  New self-service tools such as Tableau and Qlik are allowing power users or subject matter experts to create and transform data to allow business users to more quickly access the data to help answer business questions. The problem with the traditional business analyst process of the past is the data needed to be found, provisioned, prepped, and then analyzed.  Part of the process included creating critical data elements can not rapidly change as according to new user requirements . This is a complete contrast to growing up with Google and Wikipedia.  The pure volume of data makes it impossible to document and tag everything, this is where new tools that leverage machine learning and auto-tracking of data consumption creates catalogs of tribal knowledge.  This is much a kin to the search scoring that powers search engines. In order to make consumption of the data easier, many tools are being used to prepare the data to be consumed applications.  This is where the data wrangling aspect of most data mining and data science projects spend the majority of the time. Like Excel, which is impractical for large data lake files, newer tools are being used to clean and shape the data to the right form.  Some of the vendors providing these tools are Alteryx, Datameer, Paxata, and Trifacta as well as traditional vendors such as Informatica and Talend provide tools with the idea of providing self-service for the business analyst. Combining data or joining data sets is where much of the value from data lakes becomes immediately useful.  Unfortunately, common ids are uncommon amongst separate data sets.  This is where the idea of entity resolution becomes instrumental in capturing value from the data.  Master Data Management systems with probabilistic matching engines that have rules for defining matched entities help in joining data sets.  One company providing entity resolution products is Tamr. 5.  **What are the data governance issues that need to be addressed? The centralized nature of a data lake could allow for greater governance versus heterogenous systems that use different technologies.  Stewardship of data lakes is key to creating trusted users that have organizational responsibility for the data.  Some form of provisioning of the data is one of the critical problems of data lakes.  One approach that has been widely adopted is only allowing analysts access to data they need for there specific job function.  An example could be allowing access based on location or some other form of limiting data. Data lake users and zones are typically segmented into four zones: a landing zone where data scientists, developers, and data engineers have access; a gold zone where analysts and data scientists have access; a work zone for data scientists and data engineers; and finally a sensitive zone where data stewards and trusted analysts have access. One approach to governance is to implement a method for de-identifying sensitive data.  Since the data is written quickly without schema, the ability to tag data on original write is limited for efficiency reasons.  Some profiling tools have been built to scan the data lake and look for sensitive data.  These tools include DataGuise and Waterline Data. Another approach is transparent encryption that is offered by Cloudera Navigator  that encrypts data when it is written and de-crypts the data when read. ","categories": [],
