### **What is Entity Resolution?**
Entity Resolution is the task of disambiguating manifestations of real world entities in various records or mentions by linking and grouping.[^fn1] Effectively reducing something to its most basic conical form. Linking entities to form relationships and draw conclusions from data is becoming increasingly relevant as data lakes become prevalent in organizations and protecting data integrity expectations increases especially as it relates to making use of private personal data. Many organizations ranging from government and public health data, web search, comparison shopping, law enforcement are being expected to provide a higher level of transparency and protection of the data being collected and used for predicting behavior and accomplishing their goals.
