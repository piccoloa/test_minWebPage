This is my first post which is being hosted on [GitHub Pages][github pages] using [Jekyll][Jekyll-site]. I hope that these posts continue to improve and offer an opportunity to share what I have learned and communicate more effectively.  This post is just me practicing how to use Jekyll and some links for those interested in how I created the site.  I began the tutorial on [this site][briancaffey] until I ran into problems with getting [Disqus comments][disqus_comments] to work.  

Check out the [Jekyll docs][jekyll-docs] for more info on how to get the most out of Jekyll. File all bugs/feature requests at [Jekyllâ€™s GitHub repo][jekyll-gh]. If you have questions, you can ask them on [Jekyll Talk][jekyll-talk].
